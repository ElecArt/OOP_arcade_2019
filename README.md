EPITECH 2nd Year school project of Object-Oriented Programming

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.

To be able to deal with the elements of the gaming plateform at run-time, the graphic libraries and the games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.

Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main program.

Operating system: Fedora
Graphic library: SFML, Allegro, Ncurses

KeyNote: 95/125
